* You can create many subapplication within on applicaiton so you do not have to initialize different boilerplate for multiple application
* Let say i have Member and Admin Dasbhoard so i can create the as two different modules or subapps with their own urls <br/>
Server API - http://localhost:7001<br/>
Admin - http://localhost:7002<br/>
Member - http://localhost:7003<br/>
* Auto Code Splitting based on modules
* Fully customizable according to your needs.
* Server Side Rendering so you can render app as Server Side or Client Side its your choice
